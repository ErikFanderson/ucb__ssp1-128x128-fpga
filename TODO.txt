1. New FPGA bit file
    a). Add additional frame driver functionality into current verilog.
    b). Re-evaluate asynchronous clock domains.
    c). Re-simulate regular and frame driver operation.
2. Verify new bit stream w/ python code
3. Add documentation to repo for
    a). Compiling bit stream
    b). Uploading bit stream
    c). Simulating verilog
    d). Python class diagram
    e). Equipment in use (optical and power driver)
    f). Running python tests on actual hardware
